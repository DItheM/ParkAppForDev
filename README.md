# ParkApp
This project is done as a mini-project in the course, EEI4369 - Mobile Application Development for Android in The Bachelor of Software Engineering Degree Program offered by The Open University of Sri Lanka. 

Our main task is to identify a problem in the real world and find a solution to it.Therefore, the problem we identified is the traffic in the parking spots in busy places. The solution to this problem is to create an application to track the traffic in parking spots. With this solution, vehicle owners can find parking spots without being frustrated. And also parking spot organizations can easily manage the spots.

Below are some key features of the app.

● Search for parking spots in real-time.

● Book parking spots.

● See parking spots with integrated google maps.

● Get directions to parking spots.
